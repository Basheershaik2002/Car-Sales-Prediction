# Car-Sales-Prediction

### Introduction:

This task aims to analyze car price data to identify trends, patterns, and insights. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, we explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, visualize key features, and derive meaningful conclusions.

### Technologies and Libraries Used:

Python: Core programming language for data analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Pandas: For handling and analyzing structured data.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: Used as the environment for running the analysis.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about different car brands, their prices, and other attributes. 

Some key columns include:

Car Brand: The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Honda, Toyota, Skoda).

Car Age: The age of the car in years.

Price: The selling price of the car.

Mileage, Fuel Type, Transmission: Additional car attributes affecting price.

### Basic Insights:

Older cars tend to have lower prices.

Certain brands retain value better than others.

Fuel type and transmission impact pricing trends.

## How to Run the Project:

1.Install necessary libraries if not already installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

2.Open Jupyter Notebook:

3.Load and execute each cell step-by-step in the provided .ipynb file.

# Conclusion:

The dataset shows a clear correlation between car age and price, with older cars generally being cheaper.

Certain brands maintain higher resale value.

Factors like fuel type and transmission significantly influence car prices.

Further analysis, such as predictive modeling, can be conducted to estimate car prices based on given attributes.

This task provides a foundation for car price analysis and can be extended by incorporating machine learning models for price prediction.
